# Cyber-Abattoir-Lab
This Project is simply to be a Step by Step Guide of how I set up my Fedora Workstation after a fresh Bare Metal Installation to handle anything it is I want a computer to do or need a computer to do for me with efficacy . Efficacy is the key word in this Project . I will keep elaborating on my schizotypal philosophy of Cyber Efficacy as this Project matures . This Guideline shall begin with the assumption the Operator ( you ) has successfully Installed the current version of Fedora Workstation on a typical x86_64 common Personal Computer. This Project has no Official affiliation to Linux or Fedora or Red Hat or IBM or any other business interest , but rather leans more towards a philosophical 'Thunking' interest. The Thunker depicts a Monster engaged in Thunking, the act of thinking Thunks, profound thinks that are never spoken aloud. And it even has a pecking bird in the ancient "Art Monstreau" style - divine!
